## 😻 Purrfect Vibrations! 😻

Hiii! 👋 I'm a little cat girl and I made this program! It turns your game controllers into... well, you know! 🤭 It's super fun and purrfect for relaxing! ✨

**What does it do?** 😼

This program lets you use your game controllers as... *ahem*... vibrating toys! You can use it with multiple controllers at once, too! It's like having a whole bunch of cuddly friends! 😽 It's inspired by the heartbeat effect in Silent Hill 2—so spooky and cool! 👻

**Features!** 😻

*   **Multiple Controller Support:** Up to 6 controllers can be used! Primary can be just a remote or synchronized with the rest. 🔁
*   **Pattern Modes:** Choose between heartbeat, interval, and more! 💖
*   **Delay Modes:** Experiment with none, random, and interval delays! 🌈
*   **Frequency Control:** Adjust the speed of the vibrations! ⬆️⬇️


**How to use it?** 😻

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have the usual Linux dev tools installed.
2.  **Compile it!**  `make`
3.  **Run it!** `./shv /dev/input/eventXX` (Replace `XX` with the event number of your controller - usually high `17`, `24`, `27`, etc.)

**Controls (Meow!)** 🐾

*   **Select Button:** Toggles the whole thing on or off! Like giving a little head boop! 😽
*   **X + O:** Switches between *interval* (steady rhythm) and *heartbeat* (pulsing)! It's like a slow purr or a fast pounce! ✨
*   **X + Square:** Changes the delay between... none, random, and stable intervals 1-8!  Like different levels of cuddles! 🥰
*   **X + RB:** Makes it go *faster*! Zoom zoom! 🚀
*   **X + RT:** Makes it go *slower*! Slow and steady wins the race... or the nap! 😴
*   **Triangle + O:** Turns the extra motor on or off!  Like petting yourself! (Extra Purrs!) 🤭
*   **Triangle + Square:** Cycles through activating each controller! (Party Time!) 🎉
*   **Triangle + RB:** Toggles the auxillary motor oscillation! (Wiggle!) 〰️

**Supported Controllers** 🎮

*   DualShock 3 & 4 😻
*   8BitDo Pro 2 💖
